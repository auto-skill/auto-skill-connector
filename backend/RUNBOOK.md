# Auto-Skill Backend Runbook

## Alpha Launch Checklist

1. Back up the current `local_skills.db` and `skills_library/`:
   `.\deploy\backup-local.ps1 -PackContentBlobs`.
   New backup manifests include SHA-256 hashes; verify the backup before
   relying on it:
   `python deploy\verify_backup.py data\backups\<timestamp>`.
2. Run `python backfill_quality.py`.
3. Run `python -m unittest discover`.
4. Start the API.
5. Run `python reindex.py` to refresh active embeddings. This writes through
   the localhost API at `127.0.0.1:8000`, so the API must be running.
6. Verify:
   - `GET /healthz` returns `{"ok": true}`.
   - `GET https://mcp.yourdomain.com/healthz` returns `{"ok": true}` after
     the connector HTTP supervisor and Cloudflare tunnel are running.
    - `GET /readyz` returns `ok=true` with nonzero total, active, and embedded
      row counts, a ready `embedding_runtime`, plus `scraper.running_stale=0`
      and at most one fresh running scrape.
   - `POST /route` for `create an excel spreadsheet report with formulas and
     charts` returns `full` or `hint`.
   - `POST /route` for `build a landing page for an AI automation agency` does
     not full-route to a Landingi-specific skill.
   - Route `score_debug.metrics.latency_ms`,
     `score_debug.metrics.skill_find_ms`, and
     `score_debug.metrics.injected_tokens` are under launch budgets.
6. Confirm public forwarded requests cannot reach admin or write endpoints:
   `/chat`, `/scrape`, `/seed-backlog`, `/rescan`, `/normalize-db`,
   `/normalize-db/progress`, `/skills`, `/library`, `/library/files/*`,
   `/route-metrics`, `/route-feedback`, and mutating or read/RPC `/rest/v1/*`
   should be blocked by the read-only guard when forwarded through Cloudflare.
7. Run the launch preflight:

```powershell
python launch_check.py --base-url https://skills.yourdomain.com --mcp-health-url https://mcp.yourdomain.com/healthz
```

For a local dry run before the API is running:

```powershell
python launch_check.py --skip-http --skip-docker --skip-env --skip-local
```

## Legacy Windows Host Update

The old alpha host ran three PowerShell restart loops behind a Cloudflare
Tunnel. This is now a legacy/emergency recovery path only; do not treat a
friend's laptop or desktop as launch hosting.

- `start_scraper.ps1`: starts `python scraper.py`, which serves the FastAPI API
  on `localhost:8000` and can also run the scraper loop.
- `start_connector_http.ps1`: starts the connector MCP HTTP service on
  `localhost:8765`. It auto-detects common connector checkout locations; set
  `AUTO_SKILL_CONNECTOR_DIR` before launching if the connector repo lives
  somewhere else.
- `start_cloudflared.ps1`: exposes `skills.autoskill.dev` and
  `mcp.autoskill.dev` to those local ports.

The first fix for public `403 {"error":"read-only public API"}` responses on
`/readyz` or `/route` is to pull and restart the API host. Old code allowed
public `/healthz` but blocked those newer route/readiness endpoints.

On the host:

```powershell
git pull --ff-only origin main
.\deploy\update-host.ps1 -SkipPull -RestartTasks
```

`update-host.ps1` creates a local SQLite/library/content-blob backup and runs
`verify_backup.py` before pulling, restarting, or running public checks. Use
`-SkipBackup` only after confirming a fresh verified backup already exists.
Add `-UploadBackupR2` when R2 credentials and the AWS CLI are available.
`-RestartTasks` restarts `AutoSkill-API`, `AutoSkill-MCP`, and
`AutoSkill-Tunnel` after tests and maintenance steps, then runs the public
launch check. If legacy rows have not been quality-gated yet, run the backfill
while the API is stopped or quiet:

```powershell
python backfill_quality.py
```

Install or refresh the user-level scheduled tasks so the three restart loops
come back after host reboots and a daily local backup runs at `03:15`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\install-windows-tasks.ps1 -StartNow
```

To inspect before changing Task Scheduler, add `-DryRun`. To schedule the daily
backup at another local time, pass `-BackupAt HH:mm`. Local backup retention
defaults to 14 days; change it with `-BackupRetentionDays N`. Add
`-UploadBackupR2` only after R2 credentials and the AWS CLI are available on
the host. To remove the tasks:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\install-windows-tasks.ps1 -Unregister
```

After the API is running on `localhost:8000`, refresh active embeddings if
needed:

```powershell
python reindex.py
```

Finally prove the legacy public service is serving the new code:

```powershell
python launch_readiness.py
python launch_status.py
python launch_status.py --profile canonical
python launch_check.py --base-url https://skills.autoskill.dev --mcp-health-url https://mcp.autoskill.dev/healthz --skip-env --skip-docker
```

`launch_readiness.py` is the quick "are we ready?" answer. It checks local
seed data, alpha public status, canonical public status, and whether the repo
has uncommitted launch changes. It is intentionally a summary; use
`launch_check.py` for the full gate once the summary is green.

Before replacing runtime data on a host, validate the candidate seed artifact:

```powershell
python launch_readiness.py --skip-live --skip-local-seed --skip-git --seed-backup-dir C:\path\to\backup
python launch_readiness.py --skip-live --skip-local-seed --skip-git --seed-backup-zip C:\path\to\backup.zip
python launch_readiness.py --skip-live --skip-local-seed --skip-git --seed-db-path C:\path\to\local_skills.db --seed-library-dir C:\path\to\skills_library
```

The candidate checks verify backup manifests/hashes, SQLite integrity, nonzero
total/active/embedded skill counts, and indexed markdown skill files.

If another laptop has the populated runtime data, create a transfer packet from
that machine:

```powershell
.\deploy\export-seed-packet.ps1 -DbPath C:\path\to\local_skills.db -LibraryDir C:\path\to\skills_library
```

The helper creates a manifest-backed backup under `data\seed-packets\`, verifies
the manifest and hashes, runs the candidate readiness checks, and writes a zip
next to the backup directory for transfer. It also validates the produced zip
with the same candidate checks. After copying and extracting the zip on the
host, validate it again with:

```powershell
python launch_readiness.py --skip-live --skip-local-seed --skip-git --seed-backup-dir C:\path\to\extracted\20260708T200000Z
```

Then pass it to `recover-host.ps1 -SeedBackupDir`.
Alternatively, pass the copied zip directly to the recovery path:

```powershell
.\deploy\recover-host.ps1 -SeedBackupZip C:\path\to\20260708T200000Z.zip -ForceSeedRuntime
```

The `alpha` launch-status profile checks the current emergency hostnames:
`skills.autoskill.dev` and `mcp.autoskill.dev`. The `canonical` profile checks
the production-facing hostnames: `skills.autoskill.dev` and `mcp.autoskill.dev`.
Do not call the hosted product production-ready until the canonical profile
resolves in DNS and passes the same health, readiness, route, and MCP checks as
the alpha profile.

When `launch_check.py` is run against a local base URL, it also reads
`/route-metrics` and fails if recent routes breached the launch budgets for
latency, skill-find time, injected tokens, or response tokens. When it is run
through Cloudflare, `/route-metrics` should return `403` because analytics are
local-only.

If either public hostname returns Cloudflare `1033` / HTTP `530`, the tunnel
origin is unreachable. To apply the standard pull, connector pull, task
install/restart, local health waits, public launch check, and failure diagnosis
in one pass, run this on the Windows host:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\recover-host.ps1
```

`recover-host.ps1` updates both the backend checkout and the connector checkout
used by `start_connector_http.ps1`. If the connector repo lives outside the
auto-detected paths, pass `-ConnectorDir C:\path\to\auto-skill-connector`. If
the host intentionally pins connector code during an incident, pass
`-SkipConnectorPull`.

If `launch_status.py` reports `[NOT_READY]` with an empty skill DB or route
probes returning no candidates, the public origin is reachable but the runtime
state is missing. Seed or restore `local_skills.db` and `skills_library/`, run
`python backfill_quality.py`, start the worker or run `python reindex.py`, then
rerun `python launch_check.py`.

If the same host alternates between public `502 Bad Gateway` and empty
`/readyz` responses, treat it as one incident: the API origin is unstable and
the runtime state still needs seeding. Run `recover-host.ps1` with the seed
flags below so recovery, task restart, and runtime replacement happen in one
controlled pass.

To fold seeding into the controlled Windows host update/recovery path, pass a
verified backup directory:

```powershell
.\deploy\update-host.ps1 -SkipPull -RestartTasks -SeedBackupDir .\data\backups\20260708T200000Z -ForceSeedRuntime
```

or loose DB/library artifacts:

```powershell
.\deploy\recover-host.ps1 -SeedDbPath C:\path\to\local_skills.db -SeedLibraryDir C:\path\to\skills_library -ForceSeedRuntime
```

The integrated seed path requires `-RestartTasks`, stops `AutoSkill-API` before
replacing runtime data, restarts service tasks afterward, and intentionally
does not combine with `-RunReindex`. If embeddings are missing after seeding,
restart the API first, then run `.\deploy\update-host.ps1 -SkipPull -SkipTests
-SkipBackup -RunReindex -RestartTasks`.
`recover-host.ps1` also passes through `-RunBackfill`, `-RunReindex`, and
`-ApplyScrapeCleanup` to `update-host.ps1`; do not pass `-RunReindex` in the
same recovery command as seed replacement.

If `/healthz` still serves the stale `{"ok":true,"db_reachable":true}` body
after a normal recovery, an old Python process may still own port `8000`.
Inspect `.\deploy\diagnose-host.ps1`; if the listener command line is an
Auto-Skill scraper/MCP process, rerun recovery with scoped stale-listener
cleanup:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\recover-host.ps1 -StopStalePortOwners
```

If you only want a read-only failure packet, run:

```powershell
.\deploy\diagnose-host.ps1
```

The diagnostic checks more than process liveness. It inspects the local
`local_skills.db` and `skills_library/` seed runtime, failing when total,
active, embedded, indexed, or markdown skill counts are zero. If this fails,
seed or restore with `python deploy\seed_runtime.py` before chasing Cloudflare
or routing bugs.

For `AutoSkill-API`, `AutoSkill-MCP`, and `AutoSkill-Tunnel`, the diagnostic
reports Task Scheduler state, last run time, next run time, and last result. A
service task that is installed but not `Running` is a launch failure.

The diagnostic also posts two local route probes to `localhost:8000`: a
direct-hit spreadsheet task and the generic landing-page trap. Those probes
fail if local routing omits `score_debug.metrics`, exceeds the launch budgets
for `latency_ms`, `skill_find_ms`, `injected_tokens`, or `response_tokens`, or
full-routes the trap to a Landingi-specific skill.

If Windows blocks local scripts by execution policy:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\diagnose-host.ps1
```

Fix failures in this order: start or restart `python scraper.py` on
`localhost:8000`, fix local route probes and route budgets, start or restart
the connector HTTP service on `localhost:8765`, then start or restart
`cloudflared tunnel run auto-skill`. Only rerun the public `launch_check.py`
after local API, local route, and MCP checks pass.

Inspect route analytics locally on the host:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/route-metrics | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

Check `vector_index.valid_vectors`, `cache_ready`, `cache_vectors`, and
`matrix_bytes` there before deciding the brute-force NumPy index is the actual
bottleneck.

Use `p95_skill_find_ms`, `p95_injected_tokens`, `budget_breaches`,
`top_skills`, and `top_used_skills` to spot which routes are slow, expensive,
valuable, over-triggered, or need better skill content. Averages are useful
trend lines, but the p95 and breach counts decide whether a launch build is
quietly churning tokens or hanging on tail routes.

Archive internal eval snapshots before and after routing changes:

```powershell
python eval_search.py --json-out eval-results\$(Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd-HHmmss).json
python eval_compare.py --fail-on-regression eval-results\before.json eval-results\after.json
```

Route benchmark cases come from `evals\routes.jsonl`. Add cases there for
observed false positives, obvious direct-hit tasks, and conversation/meta
prompts that should stay at `none`.

Route outcome feedback is also local-only:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://127.0.0.1:8000/route-feedback -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"route_id":"...","outcome":"used","source":"manual-check"}'
```

`deploy\update-host.ps1` can also run the optional maintenance steps:

```powershell
.\deploy\update-host.ps1 -RunBackfill -RunReindex -ApplyScrapeCleanup
```

After the first update, the script can do the pull itself; keep `-SkipPull`
only when you already pulled in the same session.

## VPS Compose Launch Target

The launch target is a persistent VPS/small VM running `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.
Do not put production traffic on the legacy Windows/laptop tunnel. The compose
stack runs both public services:

- `api` on loopback `127.0.0.1:8000`, exposed only through Cloudflare.
- `mcp` on loopback `127.0.0.1:8765`, exposed only through Cloudflare.
- `worker`, `litestream`, and `library-backup` for scraper/reindex and R2
  backup continuity.

```powershell
Copy-Item deploy\.env.example deploy\.env
# Fill in Cloudflare/R2/GitHub/OAuth values.
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path data, skills_library
python deploy\compose_preflight.py
docker compose --env-file deploy\.env -f deploy\docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Set `AUTO_SKILL_DASHBOARD_ORIGINS` in `deploy\.env` to the exact production
dashboard origins that are allowed to receive OAuth token fragments, for
example `https://autoskill.dev,https://www.autoskill.dev`. Do not include
wildcards or temporary preview domains on the production host.

Or run the guarded launcher, which runs preflight first, starts compose, waits
for local API `/healthz` and `/readyz`, waits for MCP `/healthz`, then runs
`launch_check.py` against the local services:

```powershell
python deploy\compose_launch.py
```

The compose file is intentionally small. It keeps SQLite, the hosted MCP
connector, Cloudflare Tunnel, and Litestream on one VM. It does not introduce
Postgres, Redis, queues, Kubernetes, or a new vector server.

The compose file uses bind mounts instead of opaque Docker volumes:

- `data/local_skills.db` is mounted at `/data/local_skills.db`.
- `skills_library/` is mounted at `/app/skills_library`.

Seed a VPS by copying the current DB and library into those paths before the
first `docker compose up`.

After deploying the quality-gate image to a legacy corpus, run the one-time
backfill during a short maintenance window. It quarantines non-SKILL.md content
and clears only vectors that no longer match eligible content. The worker
rebuilds those vectors after restart:

```bash
cd /opt/auto-skill-connector
docker compose -f backend/deploy/docker-compose.yml stop worker mcp api
docker compose -f backend/deploy/docker-compose.yml run --rm --no-deps api python backfill_quality.py
docker compose -f backend/deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d api mcp
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/readyz
docker compose -f backend/deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d worker
```

Do not run `VACUUM` as part of a normal deploy. Schedule it only after a
verified R2 backup and sufficient free disk space, because it temporarily needs
roughly another database-sized amount of local storage.

To seed from loose local artifacts and validate that the result is non-empty
and embedded:

```powershell
python deploy\seed_runtime.py --db-path C:\path\to\local_skills.db --library-dir C:\path\to\skills_library
```

To seed from a verified backup directory:

```powershell
python deploy\seed_runtime.py --backup-dir .\data\backups\20260708T200000Z --force
```

`python deploy\compose_preflight.py` fails when launch-critical values are
missing from `deploy\.env`, when the seeded DB/library files are absent,
empty, unreadable, unembedded, or when `docker compose config` cannot parse the
stack. By default it requires at least one total, active, and embedded skill in
`data\local_skills.db`, plus at least one indexed markdown file in
`skills_library/`. Use
`--skip-seed-checks --skip-docker` only for CI or local config review before a
real host exists.

## Hosting Upgrade Ladder

Use this ladder to keep the alpha launch practical without pretending the
current laptop tunnel is production hosting:

1. Current emergency host: Windows restart loops plus Cloudflare Tunnel. This
   is acceptable for local debugging and recovery only. Any Cloudflare
   `1033`/HTTP `530` from `launch_check.py` means the public alpha is down.
2. Launch target: one cheap VPS or small VM running `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.
   Keep SQLite on the host disk, replicate it with Litestream to R2, back up
   `skills_library/` to R2, and run exactly one `worker` scraper process.
3. Managed-host fallback: if a VPS is too much operational work, use a service
   with a persistent disk and a background worker. Keep the same SQLite/R2
   model and the same `launch_check.py` gate.
4. Hosted DB migration: move to Turso/libSQL, Postgres/pgvector, or another
   online vector store only after metrics prove a reason. Valid reasons are
   repeated host reliability failures after the VPS move, SQLite write
   contention, a need for multiple live reader regions, or route metrics
   showing `skill_find_ms`/vector cache growth as the bottleneck.

Do not split storage just because raw skill files feel awkward. For alpha,
SQLite plus `skills_library/` backups are cheaper to operate than a new online
DB, object store read path, and migration surface. R2 is useful now for
backups and content-addressed blob exports; it should become runtime storage
only after `/content/{hash}` has a local cache and restore drill.

## Hosted Storage Decision

For alpha, keep runtime state boring:

- `local_skills.db` remains the source of truth on one backend host.
- Litestream replicates SQLite WAL/backups to Cloudflare R2.
- `skills_library/` stays as recoverable SKILL.md files, backed up as tarballs
  and optionally exported as deduped compressed content blobs.
- Only one supervised scraper/worker should write at a time.

Do not move the live route path to Turso/libSQL, Postgres, or a hosted vector
database just to look production-grade. Revisit that when one of these becomes
true: the host is unreliable after scheduled tasks/tunnel fixes, SQLite write
contention shows up in metrics, multiple regions need live reads, or
`skill_find_ms`/vector cache size proves local search is the bottleneck.

## Backups

Litestream covers `/data/local_skills.db` in the compose setup. The
`library-backup` service also uploads a daily tarball of `skills_library/` to
Cloudflare R2 through the S3-compatible API.

Keep both. SQLite has the searchable metadata and vectors; `skills_library/`
currently has the SKILL.md content used for full routes and `/content/{hash}`.

On the current Windows tunnel host, take a one-shot backup before deploys:

```powershell
.\deploy\backup-local.ps1 -PackContentBlobs
```

That writes a timestamped folder under `data\backups\` containing a SQLite
online backup, a `skills_library.tgz` archive, optional compressed content
blobs, and `manifest.json`. Timestamp-named local backup folders older than 14
days are pruned by default; pass `-RetentionDays 0` to disable pruning for a
manual run. To upload the same artifact to R2:

```powershell
.\deploy\backup-local.ps1 -PackContentBlobs -UploadR2 -R2Prefix alpha-host-backups
```

If Windows blocks local scripts by execution policy, run the same command as:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\backup-local.ps1 -PackContentBlobs
```

The Windows scheduled-task installer registers `AutoSkill-Backup` to run the
same local backup daily:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy\install-windows-tasks.ps1 -BackupAt 03:15
```

`deploy\diagnose-host.ps1` warns when no backup manifest exists or the newest
manifest under `data\backups\` is older than 30 hours. It also reports backup
footprint and warns when the repo drive has less than 5 GB free; override with
`-MinFreeDiskGb N`.

To prepare deduped compressed content blobs for R2:

```powershell
python pack_content_blobs.py
aws --endpoint-url $env:R2_ENDPOINT s3 sync content_blobs "s3://$env:R2_BUCKET/skills-content/"
```

This is a content-addressed export, not yet the runtime source of truth. Keep
the normal `skills_library/` backup until `/content/{hash}` reads from R2 or a
local cache.

Useful backup checks:

```bash
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=50 litestream
docker compose --env-file deploy/.env -f deploy/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=50 library-backup
```

Monthly restore drill:

1. Download or create a timestamped backup directory with `manifest.json`.
2. Verify and restore it into a scratch directory.
3. Start the API against the scratch DB/library.
4. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
5. Probe `/route` with the platform trap and a direct-hit query.

On Windows, after downloading a backup directory:

```powershell
.\deploy\restore-local.ps1 -BackupDir .\data\backups\20260708T200000Z
```

For a scratch restore drill that does not replace the live repo paths:

```powershell
.\deploy\restore-local.ps1 -BackupDir .\data\backups\20260708T200000Z -TargetDataDir .\restore-drill\data -TargetLibraryDir .\restore-drill\skills_library
```

If you only have loose restored artifacts instead of a manifest-backed backup
directory, verify them manually before using the older explicit path form:

```powershell
.\deploy\restore-local.ps1 -DbPath .\restored\local_skills.db -LibraryArchive .\restored\skills_library.tgz
```

## Health And Readiness

- `/healthz` is for uptime checks: process responding.
- `/readyz` is for serving readiness: DB reachable with at least one total,
  active, and embedded skill row plus a loadable local embedding model. It also
  includes `scraper.running_recent`, `scraper.running_stale`,
  `scraper.last_success_at`, and recent run rows.

Use `/healthz` for container health checks and `/readyz` for deployment
promotion checks. Treat `scraper.running_stale > 0` or `running_recent > 1` as
an alpha launch blocker even if search can still serve from the existing DB.

## Scraper Supervision

The compose setup runs scraping in the `worker` service only. Keep
`AUTO_START_SCRAPER=0` on the public API so accidental API restarts do not
start extra scrapes.

If a scrape run is marked `error`, the worker skips the embedding drain for
that cycle and waits for the next interval. Fix the scrape failure first
instead of treating missing embeddings as the primary problem.

Before a worker starts a new run it marks `running` rows older than
`STALE_SCRAPE_RUN_SECONDS` as `stale`, then refuses to start if a fresh
`running` row already exists. If `/status` shows several fresh running rows,
more than one scraper process is active; stop the extra process before
trusting the run counts.

SQLite also enforces a single `status='running'` scrape row, so a duplicate
worker startup should fail fast instead of creating a second active scrape.

Without `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the worker does not attempt code search, topic
expansion, or deep sweeps. It performs a bounded incremental repository crawl
that stays below anonymous API limits. Add a token for full discovery coverage;
do not compensate by raising the anonymous caps.

After stopping the extra process, clean up stale bookkeeping rows:

```powershell
python cleanup_scrape_runs.py
python cleanup_scrape_runs.py --apply
```

## Known Alpha Limits

- The API and worker are split in compose, but the public app still includes
  local REST write routes for the internal worker. The read-only middleware is
  the public safety boundary; Cloudflare must route only to the API.
- Existing legacy rows need `backfill_quality.py` before quality metrics are
  trustworthy.
- The brute-force NumPy vector cache remains. Quality backfill should shrink
  the active set first. The cache is invalidated on writes and held until an
  explicit invalidation by default, so `/readyz` no longer rebuilds it every
  minute. Use `/route-metrics`, `eval_search.py`, and
  `launch_check.py` latency budgets before migrating to sqlite-vec, libSQL, or
  a hosted vector service.
- `skills_library/` should eventually move into SQLite content rows so one
  Litestream backup covers all runtime state. For alpha, daily R2 tarballs are
  acceptable and easier to operate.
